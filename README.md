# Team Stats
## Project #31 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
Team Stats lets you create, retrieve, and add information about your favorite sports team. This project uses JavaScript objects (team), their properties (_players and _games), the array properties within them (firstName, lastName, age, opponent, teamPoints, and opponentPoints), and the getter/setter object accessors. The relevant data was added using the addPlayer() and addGame() methods.
## What I Learned
  - Making property arrays with multiple properties nested within them
  - Implementing methods that add new items to the arrays
